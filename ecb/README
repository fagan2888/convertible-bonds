                       USING THE WINDOWS BINARY
		       ========================

Using ecb directly
------------------
You can use ecb directly. The windows binary is ecb.exe in the 
directory ecb. This is the only file that you need if you plan to use
ecb directly under Windows. All other files in this distribution are 
then redundant. But you may still find ecb-run-raw.bat useful. 

ecb takes only one argument which is the input file. If this argument 
is omitted ecb reads input from standard input so that you can pipe 
input into ecb from some other program.

ecb takes XML input and produces XML output. It is designed to be used
in conjunction with some XML tools that will do error checking on the 
input file and format the output for human reading. This is discussed
below.


Using ecb with XML tools
------------------------
Since ecb reads XML inputs and produces XML output, I strongly 
recommend that you use ecb in conjunction with some XML tools.

1. ecb does no error checking on the input. The way I use ecb is to 
pass the input file through an XML Schema Validator which does the 
error checking by ensuring that the input file corresponds to the 
schema defined in ecbdata.xsd.

XML Schema Validators are available for free download.
I use xsv from the W3 Consortium (http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema or
http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/xml/ or 
ftp://ftp.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/pub/XSV/XSV12.EXE

2. The XML output is not designed for human reading, but is ideal
if you want to use that output as an input to another program. The
way I use ecb is that I pass its output through an XSLT processor
using the XSL file xmlout.xsl. If you do not like the output format
you can design your own XSL file.

XSLT processors are also available for free download.
I use sabcmd from the Ginger Alliance: (http://www.gingerall.com)

Batch files for combining ecb with XML tools
--------------------------------------------
Included in the distribution are three batch files that combine ecb 
with XML tools in different ways.

1. ecb-run-raw.bat uses no XML tools. It simply runs ecb and pipes the
output through "more" for easier reading. Alternatively, it can send 
output to a file.
Usage ecb-run-raw [--help] infile [outfile]

2. ecb-run-nocheck.bat passes the output through an XSLT processor to 
produce human readable output. This output is piped through "more" or
sent to an output file.
Usage ecb-run-nocheck [--help] infile [outfile]
To use this, you must download and install an XSLT processor and change
the line
set xslate=sabcmd
to set the correct path and program name of the XSL Processor.

3. ecb-run.bat passes the input file through an XML Schema Validator
which ensures that the file conforms to the schema definition. Only then
does it run ecb. The output is passed through an XSLT processor to 
produce human readable output. This output is piped thorugh "more" or
sent to an output file.
Usage ecb-run [--help] infile [outfile]
To use this, you must download and install an XSLT processor and change
the line
set xslate=sabcmd
to set the correct path and program name of the XSL Processor.
In addition, you must download and install an XML Schema Validator and 
change the line
set validate="C:\Program Files\xsv\xsv"
to set the correct path and program name of the XML Schema Validator. 


                      BUILDING ECB 
		      ============
ecb can be built under Linux (or a Linux-like environment under Windows)
using gcc. The Windows binary was built using gcc 2.95 under Cygwin in 
Windows 98. It was built to link with the MINGW library to produce a
binary that runs as a native Windows application without any other dll's.

I believe that ecb does not use any Unix specific or Windows-specific 
features and should build smoothly in any Operating System. It compiles
with the -pedantic switch set in gcc implying that it conforms strictly
to ANSI C++ and does not use any gcc-specific features. It should therefore
compile with any other C++ compiler that conforms to ANSI C++. It does 
however need a modern C++ compiler as it uses C++ templates and namespaces
extensively. It also uses the Standard Template Library (STL).

I would imagine that if you have a modern C++ compiler, you should be able
to build ecb in any environment without difficulty. 

If you are in a Unix clone that supports make, you can use the Makefile
in the source directory under ecb. Just cd to this directory and run "make"
to build ecb and run "make clean" to remove all the unwanted object files. 
The Windows binary in this distribution was created using "make MINGW=1" to
compile in the MINGW libraries while running gcc under cygwin.  But I see no
reason to use this switch except to produce a Windows binary for 
distribution.

If you want to build under MS Visual C++ or some other development
environment which does not support make, you need to compile all 
the .cpp files listed in the makefile and link all of them
together. Of course, you need a modern compiler that supports templates,
namespaces and STL.
